# PyBer_Analysis
 # The purpose of this project is to look the total fares in a week by city. The different type of cities that will be looked at is Urban, Subarban and Rurual. With the results, we get, it will help the people making informed decisions about their transportation. 


# Results
# The dates that are being looked at for this analysis is from January 1, 2019 through April 29, 2019.The results indicates the highest city type of fares by week is Urban. The number of riders and drivers indicate the total volumes is greater. The second highest ranking type of city is Suburban. The third ranking city type is Rural. The trend for the city types are similar for the most part.  if you saw one city type having an influx of riders or drivers you saw the other city types having an influx too. The number of rides and fares was different for each city types though. For example, there was a spike on 04/24/19 where Rural was at $41.06, Suburban was at $1,412.74 and Urban was at $2,466.29. When looking at fares over the course of four months showed that Rural city types was always lower than Suburban and Urban. This makes sense because transportation stops normally happen where there is a need. There is a higher need in Urban cities for transportation, to help lessen the number of cars on the road. 

# Summary

# Something to help the disparities in transportation is, the CEO could try to incentives people. Here are three ideas on how people could be incentivized to use transportation services verses driving. 1) Add a tax cut to those who are not driving. When people arenâ€™t driving, it helps lesson the amount of accidents on rode, air pollution, traffic and much more. 2) Offer free ride services for people of certain tax brackets. This could help people who do not have the ability to get to a job. This could help more people be employed easier. 3) Incentives businesses to have people car pull. This could help people who do not want to take transportation still do their part in making sure the roads are safer.
